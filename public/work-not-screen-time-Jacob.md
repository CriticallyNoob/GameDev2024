Work not Screen time

study japanese on phone for next semester

find more things for old assignments

work on stuff for other classes

watch youtube videos to learn unreal engine, because its blocked on the school computers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRmn-EYt8wI&list=PLncmXJdh4q88DFCEVuGpOY3AGQwBvoQnh&index=1)

figure something else out for when I inevitably get bored of those
